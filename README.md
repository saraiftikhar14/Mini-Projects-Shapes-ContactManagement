# Mini-Projects-Shapes-ContactManagement

## Project Overview

This repository contains two mini-projects implemented in C:

### 1. Shapes
A simple program to draw and display various shapes using ASCII art. The shapes included are:
- **Square**
- **Rectangle**
- **Inverted Right Triangle**

### 2. Contact Management System
A basic system to manage contacts with functionalities to:
- **Add a Contact**
- **Search for a Contact**
- **Delete a Contact**
- **Exit the Program**

## Elements Used in the Projects

Both projects utilize fundamental C programming concepts including:
- **IF**
- **ELSE**
- **ELSE IF**
- **LOOP** (FOR LOOP, DO-WHILE LOOP)
- **STRUCTURE**
- **FILE HANDLING** in C
- **SWITCH**
- **GOTO**
- **STRING**

## Introduction

These mini-projects are designed to demonstrate the use of basic C programming constructs. The **Shapes** project focuses on creating different geometrical shapes, while the **Contact Management System** offers basic functionalities for managing contacts, which are stored and manipulated through file handling.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired project directory (`Shapes` or `ContactManagement`).
3. Compile the C source files using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
4. Run the executable generated after compilation.

```bash
gcc shapes.c -o shapes
./shapes

gcc contact_management.c -o contact_management
./contact_management
